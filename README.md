# Crypto Based Subscription Model

## Project Description

The **Crypto Based Subscription Model** is a smart contract-based decentralized system designed to manage subscription services using cryptocurrency (Ether). It allows users to subscribe to a service by paying a fixed fee in ETH, with built-in functionality for tracking active subscriptions, customizing durations, and canceling services.

## Project Vision

To provide a decentralized, transparent, and automated solution for managing recurring subscriptions using blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries and enabling global access.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Payments:** Subscribers pay using Ether, enabling borderless payments.
- **Automated Access Control:** Checks and enforces active subscription status based on blockchain timestamps.
- **Subscription Cancellation:** Users can cancel their subscriptions anytime.
- **Owner Configurable:** The contract owner can change the subscription fee and duration as needed.
- **Secure Fund Management:** Only the contract owner can withdraw funds.

## Future Scope

- **Token Support:** Allow payment via ERC20 tokens instead of only ETH.
- **NFT Subscriptions:** Grant subscription via NFT ownership for better integration and flexibility.
- **Tiered Subscriptions:** Introduce multiple tiers with varying features and prices.
- **Renewal Reminders:** Add automatic off-chain integrations to remind users of expiration.
- **Web UI Integration:** Build a user interface using Web3.js or Ethers.js for better usability.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Track active users, revenue, and churn rates through a DApp dashboard.
